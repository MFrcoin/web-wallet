jswallet is an instant cross-platform MFCoin wallet. By not requiring annoying logins and passwords, jswallet makes MFCoin simple to setup and easy to use.
Only you have control of your wallet and MFCoins
jswallet neither holds nor has access to your MFCoins or private keys. All information is stored on the client-side, so only you have control of your wallet and your MFCoins.
Your URL is Your Key
Bookmark your wallet’s secret URL to access your jswallet in the future. Please note, this is your private URL so do not share it with anyone. If you lose this URL your MFCoins will be lost forever.
Add a password for extra security
When creating your jswallet there is an option to add a password to your account. You will need to enter this password every time you access your wallet. For your own security this wallet and the server hosting it does not store any data pertaining to your private key or password, so don’t forget your password!

Please note, all transactions sent from your wallet include a .0001 mining fee. This fee helps support the MFCoin network and ensures your transaction goes through quickly.
Time delay and recommendations for use
Because jswallet uses an external block explorer to calculate available funds, it may take up to 2 minutes for funds to show up in your wallet. Mining directly to this account is not recommended. Sending to P2SH (multi-sig) addresses is currently not supported. For additional security, you can export your brainwallet phrase and/or private key in case any issues arise (see the "settings" button).
Max send feature
Type "max" in the send amount field to see the maximum amount you can send from your wallet.
MFCoin price indicator
The MFCoin price shown in the top header is calculated from cryptsy.com and the price shown in your currency of choice.
